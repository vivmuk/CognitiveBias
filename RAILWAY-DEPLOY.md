# Deploying to Railway

## Quick Deploy Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)**
   - Sign in or create an account (GitHub login works great)
   - Click "New Project"

2. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository: `vivmuk/CognitiveBias`
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

3. **Configure Deployment**
   - Railway will automatically:
     - Detect `package.json`
     - Install dependencies (`express`)
     - Run `npm start` (which runs `server.js`)
   - No additional configuration needed!

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically deploy
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Option 3: Deploy via GitHub Integration

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. In Railway dashboard:
   - New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
   - Select your repo
   - Railway auto-deploys on every push!

## Configuration

The project includes:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts
- `server.js` - Express server to serve static files
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration (optional)

## Environment Variables

If you need to set environment variables (like API keys):

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add variables:
   - `PORT` (optional, Railway sets this automatically)
   - `VENICE_API_KEY` (if you want to move API key to env vars)

## Custom Domain

1. In Railway dashboard → Settings
2. Click "Generate Domain" or add custom domain
3. Railway provides free HTTPS automatically!

## How It Works

- **Express Server**: Serves all static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Port**: Railway sets `PORT` environment variable automatically
- **Static Files**: All files in the root directory are served
- **Routes**: 
  - `/` → redirects to `/bias-learning-hub.html`
  - `/index.html` → redirects to `/bias-learning-hub.html`
  - `/health` → health check endpoint

## Advantages of Railway

✅ **Simple Deployment**: Just connect GitHub and deploy
✅ **Auto HTTPS**: Free SSL certificates
✅ **Custom Domains**: Easy domain setup
✅ **Environment Variables**: Secure API key storage
✅ **Auto Deploys**: Deploys on every Git push
✅ **Logs**: Built-in logging dashboard
✅ **Scaling**: Easy to scale if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Railway build logs
- Ensure `package.json` is correct
- Verify Node.js version (18+)

### Site Not Loading
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Verify `server.js` is running
- Check the generated URL

### API Not Working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS settings (Railway should handle this)
- Check API key is correct in `venice-api.js`

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test the site**: Visit your Railway URL
2. **Test Venice AI**: Try the AI exploration features
3. **Check logs**: Railway dashboard → Deployments → View logs
4. **Set up custom domain** (optional)

## Continuous Deployment

Once connected to GitHub:
- Every push to `main` branch = automatic deployment
- Railway shows deployment status
- Rollback available if needed

## Cost

- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month (plenty for this static site)
- **Hobby plan**: $5/month for more resources
- This static site uses minimal resources

Enjoy your deployed Cognitive Bias Learning Hub! 🚀
